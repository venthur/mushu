"""
This module provides the :class:`AmpDecorator` class.

As a user, it is very unlikely that you'll have to deal with it
directly. Its main purpose is to add additional functionality to the low
level amplifier drivers. This functionality includes features like:
saving data to a file. or being able to receive marker via network
(TCP/IP and UDP).

By using the :func:`libmushu.__init__.get_amp` method, you'll
automatically receive decorated amplifiers.

    You use it by decorating (not as in Python-Decorator, but in the GoF
    sense) the low level amplifier class you want to use::

    Waring: The network marker timings on Windows have a resolution of
    10ms-15ms. On Linux the resolution is 1us. This is due to
    limitations of Python's time.time method, or rather a Windows
    specific issue.

    There exists currently no precise timer, providing times which are
    comparable between two running processes on Windows. The performance
    counter provided on Windows, has a much better resolution but is
    relative to the processes start time and it drifts (1s per 100s), so
    it is only precise for a relatively short amount of time.

    If a higher precision is needed one has to replace the time.time
    calls with something which provides a better precision. For example
    one could create a third process which provides times or regularly
    synchronize both processes with the clock synchronization algorithm
    as described here:

        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol

    Alternatively one could use `timeGetTime` from Windows' Multi Media
    library, which is tunable via `timeBeginPeriod` and provides a
    precision of 1-2ms. Apparently this is the way Chrome and many
    others do it.::

        from __future__ import division

        from ctypes import windll
        import time

        timeBeginPeriod = windll.winmm.timeBeginPeriod
        timeEndPeriod = windll.winmm.timeEndPeriod
        timeGetTime = windll.winmm.timeGetTime

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            # wrap the code that needs high precision in timeBegin- and
            # timeEndPeriod with the same parameter. The parameter is
            # the interval in ms you want as precision. Usually the
            # minimum value allowed is 1 (best).
